Diabetes is a prevalent illness that affects the health of many people in today’s society,
there has been a rise in associated diseases that are affecting the community. Diabetic
Retinopathy (DR) is an example of a silent disease that can occur as a result of either
Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and can lead to permanent blindness if not diagnosed promptly.
However, the manual screening of DR by ophthalmologists is a time-consuming process.
Therefore, this project aims to use Deep Learning (DL) to analyze various DR stages and
develop a unique methodology for detecting diabetic retinopathy.



By utilizing a modified pre-trained Resent-152 architecture and improved pre-processing
techniques, our model is able to detect diabetic retinopathy with greater accuracy. The
model was trained on a large dataset, consisting of 1437 high-resolution fundus images,
to automatically identify the DR stage. The retinal images were acquired following a
clinical procedure, utilizing the Zeiss brand’s Visucam 500 camera. The dataset has been
classified by expert ophthalmologists . The DR stages are classified into seven categories,
ranging from 1 to 7. The input parameters for our model were patient’s fundus eye images, as described in this paper. Our model performed well with an impressive accuracy
of 90%
